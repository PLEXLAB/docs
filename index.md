# Getting Started
{: .fs-9 }
Welcome to Live Mache documentation. The purpose of this project is to better support building future systems for specialized, geographically distributed populations. We propose Live Participatory Design Fiction (LPDF), a set of methods and tools for participatory design through live interactive design fiction. Our long-term objective is to establish new methodologies that broaden participation of diverse stakeholders in the design of new technologies, enabling participatory design at scale. 

Use Live Mache on all machines, making use of Docker for easy install and running on local machine at //localhost. Live Mache will allow users to convey live media for emergency management, education, and training simulation.


Follow github README [link here] for to information on local installation process and machine requirements.
